High-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) permits the simultaneous measurement of many cellular markers, providing a system-wide view of immune phenotypes at the single-cell level1. Yet, the maximum number of markers that can be measure simultaneously is limited to ~50 due to several technical challenges. We propose a new method to integrate CyTOF data from several marker panels that include an overlapping set of markers, allowing for a deeper interrogation of the cellular composition of the immune system.
